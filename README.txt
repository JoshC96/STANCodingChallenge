SITE
Notes:
Comments not very necessary as code explains itself clearly even in the JavaScript.
No css or javascript inline, looks bad if it's there.
Wasn't sure exactly what to do so took ideas from Stan. site and themes.

Would like to have done better:
-Used external frameworks
-Not hardcode images into html but retreive from a database with js
-Used fontawesome for image viewer next/previous buttons
-Used php to load text

Website tested in:
-Firefox 47.0, 47.0.2, 54.0.1, 55.0.3
-Chrome 60.0.3112.113 64-bit
-Edge 40.15063.0.0
-Samsung Galaxy S5 Chrome and Internet browser - Failed test

Works in all desktop browsers

EMAIL
Style code inline because most email preprocessors remove html code.
Changed images in photoshop to fit the email better.

Email tested in:
-Gmail
-Samsung Galaxy S5 email app
-Outlook - Footer colour doesn't load

Works in Gmail and Samsung Galaxy S5 email app
