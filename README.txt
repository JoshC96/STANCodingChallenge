SITE
Notes:
No css or javascript inline, looks bad if it's there.
Wasn't sure exactly what to do so took ideas from Stan site and themes.

Would like to have done better:
-Used external frameworks
-Not hardcode images into html but retreive from a database with js
-Used fontawesome for image viewer next/previous buttons
-Used php to load text

Website tested in:
-Firefox 47.0, 47.0.2, 54.0.1, 55.0.3
-Chrome 60.0.3112.113 64-bit
-Edge 40.15063.0.0
-Samsung Galaxy S5 Chrome and Internet browser - Failed test

Works in all desktop browsers

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EMAIL
Style code inline because most email preprocessors remove html code.
Changed images in photoshop to fit the email better.

Email tested in:
-Gmail
-Samsung Galaxy S5 email app
-Outlook - Footer colour doesn't load

Works in Gmail and Samsung Galaxy S5 email app
